		description `Stella Station is seven centuries old; it was the first space station built outside of the Sol system. The station has been modified and repaired so often since that time that in all likelihood not a single deck panel or bulkhead that was part of the original station remains. Four centuries ago it was nearly destroyed by an asteroid impact, but other than that it has been a working deuterium refinery for its entire lifetime.`
		spaceport `The main ring of the station consists of three different levels, with living quarters, repair shops, a few small cafeterias, and even a barber. The lower levels also house some of the refinery equipment, but much of the harvesting is done automatically by robotic drones. For a station that is so old, everything feels surprisingly sturdy; the bolts and beams that make up the station are much thicker than they probably need to be.`
