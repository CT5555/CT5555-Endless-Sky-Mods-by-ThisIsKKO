	description "Created by all sorts of fission reactors. Spaceports have a service to remove them from your ship to be sent to waste management facilities, however you are charged for it. Although the byproducts are encased in a thick lead shell, the shell itself drains power for extra shielding against the radioactivity within for safety measures. It includes radioactive compounds like plutonium-239 which can be re-enriched as fuel or made into nuclear weapon."
